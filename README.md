**Description:**

As a person with dyslexia, I wanted a program to read text in video games aloud. However, I could never find a solution that was easy to work with, so I made this program with coding help from AI. I know it's not the best code, but in the end, I got the program to the state I envisioned, and I'm now using it in different games to help me 'read' long dialogues. I'm uploading it here so other people can use it as well.

This program relies on Tesseract OCR for text recognition, so ensure Tesseract is installed and correctly configured.
Tesseract OCR: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

Key features:
1. Define multiple areas on the screen to capture text.
2. Adjust image processing settings for better conversion of the image to text.
3. Text-to-Speech: Convert extracted text to spoken output with voice and speed customization.
4. Hotkey Integration: Assign hotkeys for each area and text-reading controls.
5. Debugging Tools: View processed images and logs in a dedicated console.
