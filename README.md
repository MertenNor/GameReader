Description:

As a person with dyslexia, I wanted a program to read text in video games aloud. However I could never find a solution that was easy to work with, so I made this program with coding help from AI. I know it's not the best code, but in the end, I got the program to the state I envisioned, and I'm now using it in different games to help me 'read' long dialogues. I'm uploading it here so other people can use it as well.

This program is a desktop application designed for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tasks with text-to-speech capabilities.
It allows users to define screen areas for text extraction, process the captured text with customizable image preprocessing options (brightness, contrast, blur, etc.), and read the extracted text aloud using text-to-speech.

Key features:
1. Multi-area OCR: Define multiple areas on the screen to capture text.
2. Customizable Preprocessing: Adjust image processing settings for better OCR accuracy.
3. Text-to-Speech: Convert extracted text to spoken output with voice and speed customization.
4. Hotkey Integration: Assign hotkeys for OCR actions and text-reading controls.
5. Debugging Tools: View processed images and logs in a dedicated console.

This program relies on Tesseract OCR for text recognition, so ensure Tesseract is installed and correctly configured.
